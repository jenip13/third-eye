# Construct-I
Project for the 2018 AI for Social Good Hackathon

We have built and trained a model to recognize the construction sites that are found at every street corner here in Montreal, aimed to aid the mobility visually impaired within the city.
By creating our own dataset with 57 images of construction sites and 57 no-contruction sites in Montreal, we were able to train and test our model using convoluted neural networks and reached an accuracy of approximatly 70%. 

Our model should be able to detect the incoming image of construction sites and alert the user that the front path is a "no go".
